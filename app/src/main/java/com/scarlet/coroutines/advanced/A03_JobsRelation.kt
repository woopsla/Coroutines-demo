 *    (for example, `GlobalScope.launch`), then it does not inherit a coroutine
 *    context from the original parent scope.
 * 2. **When a different `Job` object is passed as the context for the new coroutine,
 *    then it overrides the Job of the parent scope.**
 *
 * In both cases, the launched coroutine is not tied to the scope it was launched
 * from and operates independently.
